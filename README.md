# Peristalsis Display

Peristalsis is a display font, designed based on gestational disabilities like the irritable bowel disease that is familiar to many. It’s gross, painful and taboo to talk about digestion issues and that’s why Peristalsis was created; to display the gross albeit familiar shit we do everyday. 

Designed using Glyphs 3
